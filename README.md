#Â Project for the module Algorithms for Massive Data

In this folder you can find ```3 scripts``` which are below described:
1. ```data_downloading.ipynb``` to be executed as first, it will make you download the images from Kaggle through the Kaggle's API;
2. ```prepocessing_and_modelling.ipynb``` in which you can perform the pre-processing of the data, manipulate them a bit for a complete data understanding; here I also tried to make up some models exploring the performance of different neural networks;
3. ```model_selection.ipynb``` for the final model selection through an hyperparameters tuning.
