- If you want to **execute the code directly on Google Colab**, follow the link: [GoogleColab file here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jq5545Y0aVq2wzzqRnxvFHTeUk-9AM3q?usp=sharing)

- If instead you want **to run locally** the project you can follow the following instructions:

In this folder you can find ```3 scripts``` which are below described:
1. ```data_downloading.ipynb``` to be executed as first, it will make you download the images from Kaggle through the Kaggle's API;
2. ```prepocessing_and_modelling.ipynb``` in which you can perform the pre-processing of the data, manipulate them a bit for a complete data understanding; here I also tried to make up some models exploring the performance of different neural networks;
3. ```model_selection.ipynb``` for the final model selection through an hyperparameters tuning.
